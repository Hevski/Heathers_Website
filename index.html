    <h3>A brief history of me</h3>
  <div id="introduction">
      <p>I was born in Chester</p>

      <p>I went to school in Kirkintilloch & Lenzie</p>

      <p>After school I went to college and studied sports coaching, then lived and worked in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shrewsbury</li>
          <li>Kendal</li>
          <li>Keswick</li>
          <li>Verbier, Switzerland</li>
          <li>Chataux d'oex, Switzerland</li>
          <li>Leysin, Switzerland</li>
        </ul>
    <p>After those awesome adventures, I decided to go to university to study Sports Management.
      <br>
    I met my husband, became a mother to two beautiful dogs, bought a house and got married in NYC!
      <br>
    For the last four years I have been working as an Active Schools Coordinator, now it's time to
      <br>
    move on to new adventures. </p>
